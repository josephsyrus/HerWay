        "# HerWay: Safest Route Finder using A* Algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook implements the A* search algorithm to find the **safest possible route** between two locations. The path is determined by finding the sequence of areas that results in the lowest cumulative 'danger score'.\n",
        "\n",
        "**A* Implementation (`f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`):**\n",
        "- **`g(n)` (Cost to Reach):** The cumulative **danger score** from the start to the current node `n`. The algorithm's primary goal is to minimize this value.\n",
        "- **`h(n)` (Heuristic):** The straight-line geographical distance. This acts as a guide to ensure the algorithm finds an efficient path among equally safe options.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Features:**\n",
        "1.  **Safety-First Pathfinding:** The algorithm is hardcoded to always prioritize the path with the minimum total danger score.\n",
        "2.  **Data-Driven Danger Score:** A `danger_score` is calculated for each area based on crime counts and streetlight quality.\n",
        "3.  **Hop-by-Hop Visualization:** The final route is plotted on a `folium` map, showing all the intermediate areas (hops) from the start to the destination."
